    "text": "In this gist, I present my work during the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2022 program. In the project, I contributed code to a published book Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction (book1) and an upcoming book Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics (book2) by Kevin P. Murphy.\nI mainly worked on two repositories: i) pyprobml (public): a repositiry containing most of the source code for the book; and ii) bookv2 (private): a repository containing source code of the book.\n\n\n\nI worked on this project for 16 weeks and on an average 42 hours a week.\nI refactored the pyprobml repository to shift from .py files to .ipynb files containing code to reproduce figures.\nI added automatic code testing via GitHub workflows to pyprobml.\nI generated code for several figures in “Gaussian processes” chapter.\nI developed a Bayesian optimization library in JAX called BIJAX.\nI co-authored a section (34.7 - Active learning) with Dr. Kevin P. Murphy.\nI learned advanced tools of JAX library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn earlier version of repo, code for each figure was stored in .py files and there were Jupyter notebooks, each per chapter, containing cells to execute each of those .py files. Link to those cells were stored in a private firestore database and a short link was given with each figure in book1.\nThere were several challanges with this setup: * It was difficult to maintain and keep this setup up to date due to manual intervention needed at multiple places. * Due to full .py file execution, interactivity with code was minimal.\n\n\n\nAfter brainstorming, we decided to move from .py file per figure to a self-contained .ipynb file per figure which alleviated the need of notebook per chapter. This also enabled readers to play with the notebook more interactively or view the cached figures in the notebook. In the final version, we have notebooks stored in folders renamed as chapter numbers and integrated with book without the need of firestore database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode for any repository needs be up to date with packages it depends on. pyprobml depends on lots of packages and thus automatic GitHub workflow testing can be beneficial to test the code on every push.\n\n\n\nI implemented majority part of workflow which: i) runs and chekcks all notebooks on every push; ii) statically checks if imported modules are installed/going to be installed locally or not; iii) checks code quality with black and iv) pushes some useful statistic to other branches e.g. auto_generated_figure. Following PRs are major in making these changes:\n\n\n\nURL\nTitle\n\n\n\n\nPR 703\nAdd workflow and jupyter-book setup\n\n\nPR 764\nSplit the workflow. Enable static module checker.\n\n\nPR 795\nCombine and publish results from parallel workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaussian processes are related to my thesis topic and thus I wrote code and/or latexified several figures in the Gaussian processes chapter. Here is the list of figures generated by my code:\n\nFigure 18.2 [PR 727] explains ARD in Gaussian processes: a) same lengthscale for both dimensions; ii) lengthscale in one dimension dominates the other.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.5 and 18.6 [PR 721, PR 722] illustrates combination of GP kernels via multiplication and summation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.7 [PR 728, PR 750] illustrates noisy and noiseless Gaussian process regression: a) samples from prior; b) noiseless regression; c) noisy regression.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.18 [PR 919] illustrates GP regression with (a) Maximum likelihood and (b) Fully Bayesian inference. I added blackjax version of code for this.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.23 [PR 874] illustrates spectral mixture kernel fit with GPs. I latexified this figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.26 [PR 871] illustrates Deep kernel learning with Gaussian processes: a) fit with Matern kernel; b) fit with MLP + Matern kernel. I latexifed this figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe initially thought of writing a generic piece of code to generate multiple Bayesian inference related figures in book2. However, realizing the power of Bijactors (transformation functions) in recent methods like ADVI and a posibility of applications for a wider community, we are developing BIJAX as a full library. BIJAX supports MAP, ADVI and Laplace approximation. We are developing SteinVI and other methods in BIJAX at present.\nFollowing are the figures developed with BIJAX:\n\nGaussian Mixture Model with ADVI [PR 1084]: a) MAP; b-d) posterior samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating mean of 2d Gaussian distribution with ADVI [PR 1081]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe work on active learning in our lab and earlier I have published an interactive active learning article at VizxAI. Thus, I helped Dr. Murphy write the section on active learning in book2. I mentored two of non-GSoC students (Nitish and Ankita) from our lab at IIT Gandhinagar for generating all figures in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring GSoC, I got introduced to JAX for the first time. After some exploration, I found JAX as a quick and computationally fast prototyping library. Tools like vmap, jit, tree_util and flatten_util were elementry in the code I wrote during GSoC. I summarized the JAX tricks we learned during the GSoC period here.\n\n\n\nFollowing table containts the list of PRs created during the GSoC period sorted by time.\n\n\n\nURL\nTitle\n\n\n\n\nPR 690\nUpdate beta_binom_post_plot.py\n\n\nPR 703\nAdd workflow and jupyter-book setup\n\n\nPR 704\nAdded discrete_prob_dist_plot.ipynb\n\n\nPR 707\nDo not auto generate scripts\n\n\nPR 709\nRename environment variables\n\n\nPR 719\nRemove jupyter book\n\n\nPR 721\nadd combining_kernels_by_multiplication notebook\n\n\nPR 722\nadd combining_kernels_by_summation notebook\n\n\nPR 727\nFig18.2 (Book2) add gprDemoArd.ipynb\n\n\nPR 728\nFig18.7 (Book2) add gprDemoNoiseFreeAndNoisy.ipynb\n\n\nPR 741\nconverted py files to notebooks.\n\n\nPR 750\nUpdate gprDemoNoiseFreeAndNoisy\n\n\nPR 763\nMention Python version in README\n\n\nPR 764\nSplit the workflow.
